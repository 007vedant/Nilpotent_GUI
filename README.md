# Nilpotent_GUI
## A GUI App to check if matrix is nilpotent. :rocket:

### Developer: Vedant Raghuwanshi (118EE0705) :technologist:

### Project: Check if the matrix is Nilpotent :memo:

### Course: Advanced Control System (EE2002) :page_facing_up:


### Overview: :construction:

1. The project contains two main directories viz. dist and src. All the source code for project is present inside the src directory. Each of the src files can be run as an individual script or the entire Graphical User Interface(GUI) can be launched after installing the application from MSI-Installer inside dist directory.
2. The app can be rebuilt locally for Linux and MacOSX systems using setupy.py script.


### Instructions for using the App: :bulb:

1. Install the application from the MSI-Installer inside dist after choosing any install destination.
2. Launch the GUI by opening the main.exe file.
3. Enter the size of your input matrix inside the box and click 'Run'.
4. A window will popup with a matrix of the given size, with all the default values as inf.
5. Click on each cell, enter the number you want to input in that cell and press 'Enter' to fix it inside the cell.
6. After you've entered all the numbers for the matrix, press 'Space'.
7. A window will popup with the message about the kind of matrix.


### NOTE: :rotating_light:
1. The App supports complex numbers, which should  be input as Python requires them to be. Do not add whitespace between any operands while entering the numbers.
   Correct Examples: 1+2j, -1-2j, 1.0-2.0j, 0j, 1.11+3.2j
2. The App does not support 'BackSpace', press 'Delete' to remove the entire number.
3. Press 'Enter' after typing the number to register it inside the cell, else it'll take the default 'inf' value.
4. Since calculations are not possible with 'inf' values, replace all the cells with your input values or else the App will throw an unexpected calculation.
